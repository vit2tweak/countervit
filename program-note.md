# CounterVit - Development Notes

## Project Overview
A modern counter application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Features a clean, responsive interface with persistent state management.

## Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling approach

### Key Features
- Increment/Decrement counter functionality
- Reset counter to zero
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Responsive design
- Type-safe implementation
- Custom hooks for state management

### Component Structure
```
App
├── Counter (main counter component)
└── useCounter (custom hook for counter logic)
```

### State Management
- Custom `useCounter` hook encapsulates counter logic
- localStorage integration for persistence
- Type definitions for counter state

### Styling Approach
- CSS modules for component-scoped styles
- Global styles for base styling
- Responsive design principles
- Clean, modern UI design

## Development Guidelines
1. Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Follow React best practices
4. Maintain component separation of concerns
5. Use semantic HTML elements
6. Ensure accessibility compliance

## Future Enhancements
